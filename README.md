#iPokédex SQLite Database
This is the dumped contents of the SQLite database I created for iPokédex, the comprehensive Pokémon app I made in 2011.

Sourced from multiple Pokémon fansites, the iPokédex was lovingly handcrafted using a series of PHP scripts (Yeah... I know. XD), as well as simple copy-pasting.

The main sources of the Pokémon data included:
* [Bulbapedia](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net)
* [Veekun](http://veekun.com)
* [ポケモンWiki](http://wiki.ポケモン.com/wiki/メインページ)
* [ポケモン徹底攻略](http://yakkun.com)

While the actual source file was a standard SQLite file, I've dumped out the content to a batch of CSV files displaying the content to make the content easier to view on GitHub.

Enjoy! :)

##Installation
Accompanying the repo are two Bash scripts that can be used to either dump an instance of the database to the above mentioned format, or vice-versa, create a new database.

1. Using Terminal, set the current directory (cd command) to the one containing the shell scripts. 
2. Run ipokedex-import.sh (sh command) to generate a SQLite file.

##Usage Agreement
I'm making this available so that people can see what made iPokédex tick, as well as hopefully provide some sort of contribution to the Pokémon community at large.

That being said, while you're free to do whatever you want with the data for personal uses, the content is still copyrighted/trademarked by The Pokémon Company International, and [they have gone on record](http://www.timoliver.com.au/2011/07/21/on-ipokedex-getting-pulled/) stating they do not wish to allow unlicesend third party apps.

Please be responsible. :)
